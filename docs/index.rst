In this project we will be making an AWS Serverless Web App. We will be using an AWS Educate Student account, so anyone should have enough permissions to make this app. It is assumed that you already have not only an AWS account but also a GitHub account and know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python for the back end.
