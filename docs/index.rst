In this project we will be making an old school style video game for the `Adafruit PyBadge <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200>`_. We will be using `CircuitPython <https://circuitpython.org>`_ and the `stage library <https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library>`_ to create a `Space Invaders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders>`_ like game. The stage library makes it easy to make classic video games, with helper libraries for sound, sprites and collision detection. The game will also work on other variants of PyBadge hardware, like the `PyGamer <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242>`_ and the `EdgeBadge <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400>`_. The full completed game code with all the assets can be found `here <https://github.com/MotherTeresaHS/ICS3U-2019-Group0>`_.

The guide assumes that you have prior coding experience, hopefully in Python. It is designed to use just introductory concepts. No Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are used so that students in particular that have completed their first course in coding and know just variables, if statements, loops and functions will be able to follow along.

**Parts**

You will need the following items:

.. container:: twocol

    `Lithium Ion Polymer Battery Ideal For Feathers - 3.7V 400mAh <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898>`_
    
    PRODUCT ID: 3898

    So that you can play the game without having it attached to a computer with a USB cable.

    `Mini Oval Speaker - 8 Ohm 1 Watt <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4148>`_
    
    PRODUCT ID: 3923

    If you want lots of sound. Be warned, the built in speaker is actually pretty loud.

    `3D Printed Case <https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fHOWOY88j9A?utm_source=externalsite&utm_medium=embedver1&utm_campaign=embed>`_

    I did not create this case. I `altered Adafruit's design <https://learn.adafruit.com/pybadge-case/>`_. One of the screw posts was hitting the built in speaker and the case was not closing properly. I also added a piece of plastic over the display ribbon cable, to keep it better protected. You will need 4 x 3M screws to hold the case together.
